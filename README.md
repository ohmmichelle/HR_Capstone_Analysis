### Exploratory Analysis on Employees' Termination Status using Classification Tree

---

#### Description
##### My General Assembly Capstone Project - Technical Report using HR Data

The following technical report was created for my General Assembly Data Science Capstone project.

In this technical report I used the HRDataset_v9.csv file created by Dr. Carla Patalano and Dr. Rich Huebner to conduct analysis on employees' termination status. The data files can be found following this URL: https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set.

In this technical report, I conduct some exploratory data analysis, creating some data visualizations. I also prepare the data to build a machine learning model. I specifically build a Classification Tree model and do some model tuning to provide some insight on employees' termination.
